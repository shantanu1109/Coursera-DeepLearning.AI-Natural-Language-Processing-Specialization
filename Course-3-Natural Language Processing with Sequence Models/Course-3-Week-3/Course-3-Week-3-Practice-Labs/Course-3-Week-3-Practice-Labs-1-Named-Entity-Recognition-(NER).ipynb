    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",

    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp/supplement/6ThZO/how-to-refresh-your-workspace).\n",

    "We first start by defining named entity recognition (NER). NER is a subtask of information extraction that locates and classifies named entities in a text. The named entities could be organizations, persons, locations, times, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'images/ner.png' width=\"width\" height=\"height\" style=\"width:600px;height:150px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Is labeled as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- French: geopolitical entity\n",
    "- Morocco: geographic entity \n",
    "- Christmas: time indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else that is labeled with an `O` is not considered to be a named entity. In this assignment, you will train a named entity recognition system that could be trained in a few seconds (on a GPU) and will get around 75% accuracy. Then, you will load in the exact version of your model, which was trained for a longer period of time. You could then evaluate the trained version of your model to get 96% accuracy! Finally, you will be able to test your named entity recognition system with your own sentence."

    "\n",
    "In python, a generator is a function that behaves like an iterator. It returns the next item in a pre-defined sequence. Here is a [link](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) to review python generators. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many AI applications it is very useful to have a data generator. You will now implement a data generator for our NER application.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"ex-1\"></a>\n",
    "### Exercise 1 - data_generator\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Implement a data generator function that takes in `batch_size, x, y, pad, shuffle` where $x$ is a large list of sentences, and $y$ is a list of the tags associated with those sentences and pad is a pad value. Return a subset of those inputs in a tuple of two arrays `(X,Y)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`X` and `Y` are arrays of dimension (`batch_size, max_len`), where `max_len` is the length of the longest sentence *in that batch*. You will pad the `X` and `Y` examples with the pad argument. If `shuffle=True`, the data will be traversed in a random order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this code as an outer loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "while True:  \n",
    "...  \n",
    "yield((X,Y))  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "so your data generator runs continuously. Within that loop, define two `for` loops:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first stores temporal lists of the data samples to be included in the batch, and finds the maximum length of the sentences contained in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second one moves the elements from the temporal list into NumPy arrays pre-filled with pad values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three features useful for defining this generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The NumPy `full` function to fill the NumPy arrays with a pad value. See [full function documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.full.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tracking the current location in the incoming lists of sentences. Generators variables hold their values between invocations, so we create an `index` variable, initialize to zero, and increment by one for each sample included in a batch. However, we do not use the `index` to access the positions of the list of sentences directly. Instead, we use it to select one index from a list of indexes. In this way, we can change the order in which we traverse our original list, keeping untouched our original list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since `batch_size` and the length of the input lists are not aligned, gathering a batch_size group of inputs may involve wrapping back to the beginning of the input loop. In our approach, it is just enough to reset the `index` to 0. We can re-shuffle the list of indexes to produce different batches each time."
