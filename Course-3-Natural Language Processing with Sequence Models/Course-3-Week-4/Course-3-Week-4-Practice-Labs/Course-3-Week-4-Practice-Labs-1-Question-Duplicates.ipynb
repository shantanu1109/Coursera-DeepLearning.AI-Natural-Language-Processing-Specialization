    "# Assignment 4:  Question duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth assignment of course 3. In this assignment you will explore Siamese networks applied to natural language processing. You will further explore the fundamentals of Trax and you will be able to implement a more complicated structure using it. By completing this assignment, you will learn how to implement models with different architectures. \n",

    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp/supplement/6ThZO/how-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

    "- Learn about Siamese networks\n",
    "- Understand how the triplet loss works\n",
    "- Understand how to evaluate accuracy\n",
    "- Use cosine similarity between the model's outputted vectors\n",

    "- Predict using your own model\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you are familiar with trax and know how to make use of classes to define your model. We will start this homework by asking you to preprocess the data the same way you did in the previous assignments. After processing the data you will build a classifier that will allow you to identify whether two questions are the same or not. \n",

    "You will process the data first and then pad in a similar way you have done in the previous assignment. Your model will take in the two question embeddings, run them through an LSTM, and then compare the outputs of the two sub networks using cosine similarity. Before taking a deep dive into the model, start by importing the data set."

    "Most of the time in Natural Language Processing, and AI in general we use batches when training our data sets. If you were to use stochastic gradient descent with one example at a time, it will take you forever to build a model. In this example, we show you how you can build a data generator that takes in $Q1$ and $Q2$ and returns a batch of size `batch_size`  in the following format $([q1_1, q1_2, q1_3, ...]$, $[q2_1, q2_2,q2_3, ...])$. The tuple consists of two arrays and each array has `batch_size` questions. Again, $q1_i$ and $q2_i$ are duplicates, but they are not duplicates with any other elements in the batch. \n",

    "We'll describe the algorithm using a detailed example. Below, V1, V2 are the output of the normalization blocks in our model. Here we will use a batch_size of 4 and a d_model of 3. As explained in lecture, the inputs, Q1, Q2 are arranged so that corresponding inputs are duplicates while non-corresponding entries are not. The outputs will have the same pattern.\n",

    "This testcase arranges the outputs, v1,v2, to highlight different scenarios. Here, the first two outputs V1[0], V2[0] match exactly - so the model is generating the same vector for Q1[0] and Q2[0] inputs. The second outputs differ, circled in orange, we set, V2[1] is set to match V2[2], simulating a model which is generating very poor results. V1[3] and V2[3] match exactly again while V1[4] and V2[4] are set to be exactly wrong - 180 degrees from each other, circled in blue. \n",

    "The clever arrangement of inputs creates the data needed for positive *and* negative examples without having to run all pair-wise combinations. Because Q1[n] is a duplicate of only Q2[n], other combinations are explicitly created negative examples or *Hard Negative* examples. The matrix multiplication efficiently produces the cosine similarity of all positive/negative combinations as shown above on the left side of the diagram. 'Positive' are the results of duplicate examples and 'negative' are the results of explicitly created negative examples. The results for our test case are as expected, V1[0]V2[0] match producing '1' while our other 'positive' cases (in green) don't match well, as was arranged. The V2[2] was set to match V1[3] producing a poor match at `score[2,2]` and an undesired 'negative' case of a '1' shown in grey. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the similarity matrix (`score`) we can begin to implement the loss equations. First, we can extract $$cos(A,P)$$ by utilizing `fastnp.diagonal`. The goal is to grab all the green entries in the diagram above. This is `positive` in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will create the *closest_negative*. This is the nonduplicate entry in V2 that is closest (has largest cosine similarity) to an entry in V1. Each row, n, of `score` represents all comparisons of the results of Q1[n] vs Q2[x] within a batch. A specific example in our testcase is row `score[2,:]`. It has the cosine similarity of V1[2] and V2[x]. The *closest_negative*, as was arranged, is V2[2] which has a score of 1. This is the maximum value of the 'negative' entries (blue entries in the diagram).\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we need to pick the maximum entry on a row of `score`, ignoring the 'positive'/green entries. To avoid selecting the 'positive'/green entries, we can make them larger negative numbers. Multiply `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` with 2.0 and subtract it out of `scores`. The result is `negative_without_positive`. Now we can use `fastnp.max`, row by row (axis=1), to select the maximum which is `closest_negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll create *mean_negative*. As the name suggests, this is the mean of all the 'negative'/blue values in `score` on a row by row basis. We can use `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` and a constant, this time to create a mask with zeros on the diagonal. Element-wise multiply this with `score` to get just the 'negative values. This is `negative_zero_on_duplicate` in the code. Compute the mean by using `fastnp.sum` on `negative_zero_on_duplicate` for `axis=1` and divide it by `(batch_size - 1)` . This is `mean_negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can compute loss using the two equations above and `fastnp.maximum`. This will form `triplet_loss1` and `triplet_loss2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`triple_loss` is the `fastnp.sum` of the sum of the two individual losses.\n",

Before, going into the training, we will use a special data set up. We will define the inputs using the data generator we built above. The lambda function acts as a seed to remember the last batch that was given. Run the cell below to get the question pairs inputs. "
